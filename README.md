In order to exectue this program, download myfiles.S and the makefile and move them to the same directory as the textfile containing the list of numbers (remember that the intergers should be between -2^31 + 1, 2^31 - 1). Open the terminal and cd into that directory. Once there, execute the makefile by entering the command 'make all'. The program should have compiled successfully. Now enter into the terminal the command './file.out'. The program will prompt you to enter the name of the input file. After that, if you hit enter, the contents of the input file will be sorted in an ascending order and outputted in the file named 'output.txt'. Use the command ($ vim output.txt) or the command ($ cat output.txt) to see the contents of the output file.
